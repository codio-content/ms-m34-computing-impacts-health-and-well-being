While many devices and apps are specifically targeted to improve health, technology use in general can lead to a decline in health.

Some health issues often caused by technology use include:

- **Carpal-Tunnel Syndrome** - This issue with ligaments in the hand/wrist is often caused or aggrivated by keeping hands the same position for long periods of time, which is common for computer users.

- **Neck Problems/Headaches** - Looking down for an extended period of time, such as at a laptop screen or a smart phone/tablet, can cause problems in the neck muscles, which may lead to headaches.

- **Blood Clots** - Blood clots in the legs are partially caused by sitting for extended periods of time with very little movement or activity, which is often associated with desk jobs and computer work.

- **Eye Strain** - The artificial backlight of a screen can put strain on the eyes and cause problems with vision.

To avoid most of these issues, technology should not be used for very long periods of time. Users should take short breaks to move around and stretch the muscles being strained.
