There are many apps and programs that can be used to positively impact an individuals health. These range from general purpose like diet and exercise trackers to more specific applications such as diabetic blood monitors.

Below are some examples of applications and devices created specifically for healthy living:

- **Step counters** - such as Fitbit, iPhone app, etc.

- **Food diary apps** - for counting calories

- **Overall health apps** - for tracking weight, blood pressure, etc.

- **Remote monitoring** - devices that monitor specific levels in the body and send alerts to a phone or other device when attention is needed, such as Blood sugar/insulin montiors for diabetics or heart monitors for those with heart disease.

- **Telemedicine** - Allows doctors to visit with patients over video calls, so that patients who live far from doctors and hospitals can get an opinion on their symptoms before driving a long way to an appointment that may not have been necessary.
